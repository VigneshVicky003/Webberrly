                <h1>What was the challenge?</h1>
                <p>OEV Online was tasked with developing an MVP as a value-added module, but with the greatest technical
                    flexibility. It was necessary for OEV Online to be able to react quickly to changing conditions at
                    any time during the development phase. Even if it is “only” an MVP at first, it was important to
                    choose an architecture from the outset that would still be suitable after the MVP stage.</p>
                <div class="review">
                    <h2>"We knew that requirements could change at any time, that the front-end had to be flexible and
                        the content had to be easily modifiable."</h2>
                    <p>Nico Schönnagel, OEV solution architect</p>
                </div>
                <h1>Approach to solving the problem</h1>
                <p>OEV Online initially considered developing an application on the basis of the architectural
                    considerations itself. An Angular or React application on S3 for full flexibility and in the backend
                    a microservice architecture with Node.js. For the management of the content, a separate solution
                    would have been used.</p>
                <h1>How did Webberrly provide the solution?</h1>
                <p>Webberrly provided the development team with the possibility to focus straightway on the requirements
                    for the customers. Webberrly features an open-source headless CMS hosted natively on top of the AWS
                    serverless offering. Thus the system fulfils exactly the requirements for modern architecture.
                    Webberrly comes with a GraphQL API, which is used to communicate with the backend. Webberrly takes
                    full
                    advantages of the serverless infrastructure which in return provides a scalable and cost-efficient
                    solution. Finally, being also a headless solution, it meant the choice of the frontend stack wasn't
                    dictated by the CMS itself, which provided the required flexibility OEV Online required.</p>
                <div class="colour">
                    <p>
                        “Webberrly fulfilled the requirements exactly and gave the development team the possibility not
                        to
                        concentrate on the reproduction of a CMS system but to implement the requirements for the
                        customers.”
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>In OEV Online's example of www.s-pflegepartner.de, an MVP was developed using Webberrly, which
                    ensures
                    the stack can take the project beyond its current MVP stage. At the same time Webberrly, being a
                    serverless solution, keeps the infrastructure and maintenance cost in-line with the expectations of
                    the project's budget.</p>
                <div class="review">
                    <h2>"Even if it is only a matter of designing a small MVP for the time being, it is worth thinking
                        bigger."</h2>
                </div>
                <h1>What mattered most to OEV Online when choosing Webberrly?</h1>
                <p>Reasoning provided by - Nico Schönnagel, OEV solution architect: "We don’t like servers (it’s unfair
                    - maybe a little) but what we really like is serverless! Thus we were looking for a Content
                    Management System which is serverless so that we don’t have to care about performance issues.
                    Second, we love IaC, so it was important to us that we get something where we could deploy the whole
                    infrastructure. Additionally, we wanted to be able to add fancy things to the CMS and have it hosted
                    in our own AWS environment. And last but not least, we were looking for a headless CMS. So in the
                    end, there was just one CMS which survives"</p>
