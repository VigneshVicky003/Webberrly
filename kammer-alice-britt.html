                <h1>Project</h1>
                <p>More than half of those in need of care in Germany are cared for by relatives at home. This is a
                    mammoth task that usually places a great burden on those involved. Instead of leaving caregiving
                    relatives to deal with the flood of information on their own, the insurance company
                    Versicherungskammer created <a href="https://pflegepartner.de/">pflegepartner.de</a> - a platform
                    that bundles the most important
                    information and instructions. Laying it out for the user on as few pages as possible, and explaining
                    them in a comprehensible way. Since it is difficult to estimate how many people will use the
                    platform and at what times, the platform must be highly performant. At the same time, server
                    capacities should not be unnecessarily reserved. This makes the project a challenge from a technical
                    perspective as well.</p>
                <h1>What was the challenge?</h1>
                <p>The solution needs to be as future-proof and as flexible as possible - This was the client
                    requirement for the new platform from the very beginning. Knowing that the platform is to be
                    continuously expanded and developed, but without being able to foresee in which direction Pflege
                    Partner platform could actually develop, one thing quickly became clear: an implementation on a
                    traditional content management system is not enough. After a proof of concept, the decision was
                    finally made in favour of a Headless CMS and Webberrly, as the appropriate provider.</p>
                <div class="review">
                    <h2>"The various building blocks and the expected flexibility of the new platform were particularly
                        challenging."</h2>
                    <p>Janek Hornung, OEV DevOps Engineer</p>
                </div>
                <h1>How did Webberrly provide the solution?</h1>
                <p>Webberrly Serverless CMS was a perfect fit for this challenging project and met all the technical
                    requirements. It is an open-source project that allows for maximum flexibility. It works natively
                    and serverless on top of the AWS infrastructure, so it can scale infinitely. In addition, the system
                    is a pleasure to use from a development perspective. It is a cloud-native system that works
                    serverless. This means that you don't have to worry about performance, and you don't have to worry
                    about servers and configuring them.</p>
                <div class="colour">
                    <p>“We have already used Webberrly very successfully in other projects. The system convinced us with
                        its modern architecture and flexibility. For this lighthouse project, it was therefore
                        immediately decided that Webberrly would be the choice.”

                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>The pflegepartner.de project for the Versicherungskammer went live at the end of 2020. With this
                    launch, a new standard was set for the insurance group, and OEV successfully implemented a
                    lighthouse project with a perfect tech stack under the hood.</p>
